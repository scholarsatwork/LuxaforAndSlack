## First things first:  
All you need to get rolling is Node.js. <img height="60" width="100" src="./node.png"> (that will also install npm) 
npm is used below in the Installation Steps and is a package manager to automatically get all your dependencies.

Click here: https://nodejs.org/en/   then choose the version you want for your OS ( Mac, Windows, Linux )

#### Luxafor for Slack CLI

Make your [Luxafor](http://luxafor.com/) light change colours in sync with your [Slack](https://slack.com/) statuses.

**Green**: Active  
**Red**: Away / Do Not Disturb

## Install

```shell or bash
$ git clone https://github.com/scholarsatwork/LuxaforAndSlack
$ cd LuxaforAndSlack
$ npm i
$ npm run start
```

### Credentials

The following Slack API credentials are required to use this program:

* User **Token** _(generate a token [here](https://api.slack.com/web))_
* Client **ID** & **Secret** _(generated by creating a [slack application](https://api.slack.com/applications))_

In running this program, you will be prompted to provide these three required credentials.

## Todo

* Allow user to configure Luxafor USB device colors based on DnD status updates to a particular USER in Slack.

  You will have to setup a "Slack App" with access to your channel of choice. 
  For Instructions on how to setup a "Slack App" go [here](https://api.slack.com/slack-apps)

* NOTE: For the moment we are using a USER 'legacy token' and BOT Client ID and Client Secret.

The BOT is a "Slack App" and the User Token is a "Legacy Token" (That may get depracated at some point)

### Issues

Feel free to open issues with questions or requests.

However, this is a fun one-off project, so my responses may be slow.

### Develop

Install dependencies.

```shell or bash
$ git clone https://github.com/scholarsatwork/LuxaforAndSlack
$ cd LuxaforAndSlack
$ npm i
$ npm run start
```

* For this to work you will need to install luxafor-api and luxafor-for-slack in global

* You may need to take ownership of some directories depending on your permissions and disk owner/ access rights. 

Credentials are managed by [configstore](https://github.com/yeoman/configstore).
Previously saved credentials will be saved in  ../.config/luxafor-for-slack
